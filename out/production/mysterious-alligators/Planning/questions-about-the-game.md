##### SUBJECT: Questions About The Game

Below is a list of our questions about the game.

1. Does the referee's tile collection's order matter when playerState are exchanging tiles or is it always random?
2. Can a player eliminated by the referee rejoin the next game?
3. Can a player add tiles to a completed Q to create another Q?

Thank you!
